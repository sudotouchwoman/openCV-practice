# **Computer Vision basics**

The repo contains results of my research on computer vision using `OpenCV` and `C++`.

There are basic examples of image loading, affine transformations, image blending, brightness/contrast adjustment,
binarization, common convolutions (sharpening, blurring, edge detection), Haar cascades, digit recognition with KNN.

It is fair to say that working on this project got me interested in classification algorithms and image processing,
which later resulted into me studying ML and Data Science. A really important step for me!
